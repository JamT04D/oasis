This is a simple on-chain OTC market for ERC20 Standard Tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can either pick an order from the order book (in which case delivery will happen instantly), or submit a new order yourself.

**Oasis PRO is undergoing alpha testing: Proceed at your own risk, and use only small amounts of ETH and MKR.**

## Overview

This dapp uses Meteor as frontend; the contract side can be tested and deployed using dapple.

## Development

This project uses the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for coding standard guidelines.
We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) to automatically check for common code problems or style errors.
There's an eslintConfig section in frontend/package.json for the configuration of ESLint.
You can run the linter with:

```bash
cd frontend
meteor npm run lint
```
